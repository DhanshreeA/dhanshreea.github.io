      <description>I have recently been accepted into Outreachy&amp;rsquo;s Winter22-23 cohort and this blog is first of a series where I will document this adventure. Within this program, I am working with Ersilia which is a “non profit organization supporting drug discovery research for infectious diseases in low-income countries”.
Outreachy is a competitive program with the single aim of empowering underrepresented people in tech with many opportunities to learn and grow by contributing to open source software.</description>

      <description>Somewhere in Kyoto, 2019 Welcome to my little corner on the Internet. Like this space, I am a work in progress. I am currently based in India, and I find joy in getting computers to do fun, and mostly useful things.
A recent accomplishment I am most proud of involves riding a bicycle for three hours around Lyon, France in April 2022, when I had only learned to ride it the previous year.</description>
