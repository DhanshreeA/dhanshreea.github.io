    <p>I have recently been accepted into <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>&rsquo;s Winter22-23 cohort and this blog is first of a series where I will document this adventure. Within this program, I am working with <a href="%5Bhttps://www.ersilia.io/%5D(https://www.ersilia.io/)">Ersilia</a> which is a “non profit organization supporting drug discovery research for infectious diseases in low-income countries”.</p>
<p>Outreachy is a competitive program with the single aim of empowering underrepresented people in tech with many opportunities to learn and grow by contributing to open source software. There have been a number of <a href="%5Bhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/outreachy-what-how-why-4fb60d10a228%5D(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/outreachy-what-how-why-4fb60d10a228)">fantastic</a> <a href="%5Bhttps://ihsavru.medium.com/outreachy-the-end-87114b46def4%5D(https://ihsavru.medium.com/outreachy-the-end-87114b46def4)">articles</a> written about getting accepted as an intern, and these were my anchor during my application as well,and so I will not repeat what has already been said, however a good TL;DR is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be curious about the project that you’re applying to, and ask a lot of questions!</li>
<li>Be consistent in your contributions and your participation within the community of fellow applicants and mentors.</li>
<li>Be collaborative with your fellow applicants whether it’s in terms of helping someone get unstuck or sharing a useful resource with the community because you learn more together than you do alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose to work with Ersilia because of several reasons, some practical and some because of my values. I will get the practical reasons out of the way first:</p>
<ul>
<li>They sought four interns which naturally increased my chances of getting accepted compared to projects that sought 1 or 2 interns.</li>
<li>It is a small team which in my experience usually translates to better and effective communication and more individualized attention;</li>
<li>And finally, it involves the best of both worlds: machine learning and fundamental science (chemistry). Ever since I watched the Matrix movies I was fascinated with the idea of applying computational methods to branches of fundamental science (particularly Neuroscience, well, because The Matrix!). I have since tiptoed around computational biology and computational neuroscience by reading blogs our auditing open courses, however this seemed like a great opportunity to finally experience a part of it!</li>
</ul>
<p>As for my value system, I think <a href="https://kurzgesagt.org/">Kurzgesagt</a>&rsquo;s take on “<a href="%5Bhttps://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14%5D(https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14)">optimistic nihalism</a>” sums it up best. If there is no meaning to the world then why not assign meaning to it and why not do it in a way that ensures collective benefit of everyone. I have experienced practicing empathy, compassion, and rational thinking to be the most rewarding ways of leading life. In this light I see machine learning as a tool being put to great use within Ersilia’s mission and I am grateful that I will get to make an impact in this venture.</p>
<p>Within next posts chronicling my Outreachy story, I will cover some open source jargon, chemistry concepts I have had to brush up on and what helped me, a 101 on how machine learning with chemical datasets looks like, and everything else that I hope to learn within the coming weeks.</p>
